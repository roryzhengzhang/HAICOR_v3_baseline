        "1. Rationality of the argument that path stands for\n",
        "2. Internal semantic coherence of path\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rationality\n",
        "We assess three rationality metrics of path (*acceptability, relevance, sufficiency*) based on Blair's theory of argument rationality, where we treat path as the premise that supports the human needs that the path arrives at. For each metric, evaluators need to answer the following 5-Likert scale questions:\n",
        "- **Acceptability**: \n",
        " - A1: How acceptable is a path (premise) to you? In other words, how plausible is a path to you?\n",
        "- **Relevance**: \n",
        "  - R1: How much is a path worthy of being taken as evidence to the conclusion (predicted human needs)? \n",
        "  - R2: How likely do you take this path as evidential support to the conclusion?\n",
        "- **Sufficiency** \n",
        "  - S1: How sufficient is a path to support the conclusion? \n",
        "  - S2: How close is a path to the reasoning that you imagine most people will make to answer the same story question?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Semantic coherence\n",
        "For internal semantic coherence, we consider how many concepts maintain a consistent sense along the path. It is because that the implicit change of word sense will impair the reasonableness of the path.\n",
        "\n",
        "We define the semantic coherence of a path as:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "  \\frac{\\sum{w_{i}}}{\\text{number of intermediate concepts}}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "Where $w_{i} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ represents whether or not concept $i$ maintains a consistent word sense along the path (except the beginning and ending words). \n",

For human-modified paths, some of them still sounds irrational or irrelevant to context (e.g. 1, 10, 11). Besides, some users performed a lazy modification such as directly linking keyword to one of human needs or merely change the ending concept (e.g. 1, 8, 9 ,10, 11). In addition, a few users failed to conclude with a human need in their modified path (e.g. 3, 7, 10).\n",
